Ray tracing in a weekend.
===============================

This follows the guidance of the [ray tracing in a weekend](https://raytracing.github.io) tutorial.
The output of this is a .ppm file, my setup uses feh to display them.

There are three bash scripts also made:
* build.sh: compiles the program
* exec.sh: runs the program and outputs the result to images folder
* go.sh: runs the build, then exec scripts
